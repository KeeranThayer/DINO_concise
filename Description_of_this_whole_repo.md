Vision Transformers using the standard supervised learning method, and the new DINOv2 self-supervised learning method by Meta (2021). 
Currently used on the CIFAR10 datasets, intended to be later used on the PanNuke or Lizzard datasets for cell/nuclei classification and feature recognition.


See Vit_first.ipynb for the vision transormer built on a supervised method.

See Concise_DINO-Demo.ipynb for the ViT built using the DINO method (under 'notebooks_').
